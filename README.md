# VeInteractive-Snowballing
Design team Snowballing project - Data visualisation<br>
During my work placement in the Design Team at Ve Interactive I participated a weekly snowballing design challenge.  Each member of the team had two weeks to take on board what their colleagues had done before them and develop their project or take inspiration from that project to then create their own work.  In this way members of the team would have creative freedom to try new design resources and improve their skills.
